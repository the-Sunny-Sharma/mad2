Aim: To create a Flutter application to display image

Theory: Flutter, a versatile framework for building cross-platform 
applications, offers a widget-based approach to UI development. 
To display an image in a Flutter application, you'll import the 
image asset into the project, declare it in the `pubspec.yaml` 
file, and utilize the `Image.asset()` widget to render the image 
within the app's UI structure. By composing the UI with layout 
widgets like `Center`, `Column`, or `Row`, you can efficiently 
arrange the image and any accompanying components on the screen.

Code: lib/main.dart mein dekh

Conclusion: Hence, we have successfully created a Flutter application to display an image.
